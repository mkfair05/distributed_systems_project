# distributed_systems_project

## Architecture:
* Docker Swarm
* Redis? --NOSQL database
* GRPC? (how does this work with docker and redis?) (do i need this?)

## Steps:
1. do mass insertion of sea level temperature data into redis
2. Create basic UI
3. Create basic API to access redis database
4. Connect ui, api and redis
5. Run api and ui and redis in docker container
6. see how api/ui/database work in docker swarm / over many nodes
7. Write paper on stuff i did above
