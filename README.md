# distributed_systems_project

## Architecture:
* Docker Swarm
* Redis? --NOSQL database
* GRPC? (how does this work with docker and redis?) (do i need this?)
* DO I want to do front end in python(flask? Nodejs? ReactJs?
* API language? -python fastapi?

## Steps:
<!-- 1. do mass insertion of sea level temperature data into redis -->
1. take csv file, create api to access it
2. Create basic UI
3. Create basic API to access redis database
4. Connect ui, api and redis
5. Run api and ui and redis in docker container
6. see how api/ui/database work in docker swarm / over many nodes
7. Write paper on stuff i did above


## Other:
* read in the csv file with python
* output the csv data onto the html page
* run the html page in the docker container
* Do I need separate docker containers to run the html page and the python? Should I have separate ones?
